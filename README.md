# codingAssistant

This is a very basic and versatile coding assistant, which is able to 
analyse your current code files and help you create code files
for your project.

The assistant works with ChatGPT. You need to set up a developer account
with openai and define an API key to be able to use your account.

## setup

1. Copy the folder `assistant` to your project's root directory.
2. In lines 14 - 20 use the `system` variable, 
   to give the LLM a general understanding of its role.
3. change the `prompt` string, defined in lines 45 â€“ 47, 
   to suit your current problem.
4. store your API key in an environmental variable 
   called `OPENAI_API_KEY`. It will get imported in line 4.
5. Add or remove relevant files in lines 9 - 11.
5. Install Python, if it is not installed already.
6. In the terminal, navigate to the assistant directory and type
   `python3 codingAssistant.py` 


If you want the assistant to build up a conversation, you can 
add its responses and your prompts to the corresponding lists in lines 49 to 57.
